## Plugin Messenger - Paper

This plugin was written for my [Velocity plugin development tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL51GdsaNM19JlY0t6KNyi4vtkC5Q-4-F4) and designed to be paired with the [Plugin Messenger - Velocity]([Plugin Messenger - Paper](https://github.com/TerrorByteTW/PluginMessenger-Paper) plugin.
Plugin messaging has been around since Minecraft 1.1, which was released in 2012, over 11 years ago!

It's very simple, it implements two commands:
1. /broadcast - A broadcast command that works with MiniMessage and sends it to all players on all servers
2. /creeper - A command that requests creepers be spawned at all players on all servers

It demos the following concepts:
1. Working with Byte Streams and data outputs/inputs
2. Plugin Messaging using the default BungeeCord plugin messaging commands
3. Plugin Messaging using our own custom channels
